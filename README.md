# Brain Tumor Detection - Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview

This project is an Automatic Brain Tumor Detection System. The system utilizes machine learning techniques to classify MRI images and detect brain tumors. The project includes an Android application providing mobile access to the detection system.

## Features

- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a pre-trained model using Python and Keras.
- **Accuracy Improvement**: Improved the accuracy of the self-trained model from 97% to 98.1% through rigorous experimentation and optimization.
- **Android Application**: Created using Java and XML in Android Studio to provide mobile access to the detection system.
- **Seamless Integration**: Ensured seamless integration between different components for enhanced user accessibility and usability.
